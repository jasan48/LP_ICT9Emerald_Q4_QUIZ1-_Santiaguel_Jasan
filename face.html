		<h2>What to see?</h2>
		<p>Hey everyone! i'm Jasan Santiaguel, and for 1 blog, 1 day, day 127, I'll be writing about the 5 prettiest places (in my opinion) to go to in the Philippines!</p>
		<h2>Some Backstory</h2>
		<p>I decided to write this article because the Philippines is my home. I know that the Philippines has many surrounding problems, like corruption, pollution, all of those things, but I still appreciate my home country, and all I can do to help it to get at least a few people to travel and explore all us Filipinos have to offer! I hope you have a fun time at any of these locations, and as always, enjoy the read!</p>

	<h3>🌊 Maria Cristina Falls, Iligan City</h3>
	<p>Though I've never been here before, Maria Cristina Falls is a place that I've been wanting to travel to for ages. It's a 320-foot high waterfall, with beautiful cascades striking onto the surface of the flowing river nearby, and to top all that off, it finishes its serene beauty off being surrounded in a sparse jungle. Legend says that while 2 sisters, Maria and Cristina, were bathing in the river, the current got so strong that Maria was pushed away by it. Cristina tries her best to save her, but she ultimately fails, and both of them fall into the river and drown. The story is pretty frightening, for such a beautiful place.</p>

	<h3>💧 Hinatuan Sacred River, Surigao Del Sur</h3>
	<p>Again, I've never been here before but ever since i've heard of this place i've been dying to see it, I mean, look at that water! It looks so pristine, so clear, and so well-maintained, considering the nature of how Pasig River was so polluted so fast, I honestly expected that this place would succumb to that place too but, look at that water quality. It's so blue, that for the first time you see it, even in pictures, you almost mistake it for a giant sapphire gem deposit.</p>

	<h3>🦇 Calbiga Cave, Samar</h3>
	<p>Now, this part is for the very daring people. This place, as well as the next one, are both really creepy, so prepare yourself! This part is for those who want to go on a daring spelunking adventure with their peers, but be warned, for who knows what the darkness of caves holds.. This cave, although creepy and dark, boasts a very grand and surreal entrance, that becomes even better once you look at it in person, but exloring deep into it, you'll find many rock formations, and some strange ones, that look like living people... But don't let that scare you! It may be terrifying, but when you're actually in it, you'll get to admire all the beauty that there is to the cave system!</p>

	<h3>🏰 Fantasy World, Batangas</h3>
	<p>A lonely, ruined castle up a hill, that has been open access to travellers who pass by, welcome to the abandoned theme park, Fantasy World! Now, this is the only place I have experience with, because as a kid, I went here, along with my parents, on an extremely foggy day, which was quite scary for around an 8 year old me. I mean, imagine, you're a kid, walking into an ABANDONED theme park, with fog surrounding you, so you can't see a thing, pretty scary right! Anyways, this theme park has a lot of theories circling around it, some say it was meant to be a Disneyland in the Philippines, some say that a Japanese buisnessman went bankrupt while building the park, hence the park being the half-finished park we all know and theorize about today. Honestly, exploring this park was a blast, and I'd definately recommend going here, especially the people who are dying for an adventure</p>
